_Hints_: 
1. Create new screen in `apps/core` and export it;
2. Create a page in `apps/web/pages` called `playground.js`;
3. Create a screen in `apps/mobile/screens` called `PlaygroundScreen.js`;
4. Create a route in `packages/navigation/config/routes.js`;
5. Create a new "route" in `AppNavigator.js` for mobile app;
6. Create a button on `apps/core/search/Search.js` that navigates to the Playground screen.

To pass props, have a look at `react-navigation` [docs](https://reactnavigation.org/).

What about `next.js`?
