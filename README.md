Workshop given on 23/05/2019 by [@JoseDuSV](https://github.com/JoseDuSV) and [@RobinCsl](https://github.com/RobinCsl) in Budapest, Hungary ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º

[Meetup Event Page](https://www.meetup.com/budapest-js/events/261013918/)

## Prerequisites

- Node v11.15.0
- Yarn v1.15.2

In addition, if you would like to work with the mobile version, make sure you have set up your development environment to that end, by following these guides:
- [Getting started guide for Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation/)
- [Getting started guide from React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

## Getting started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app.git
```

Go into the resulting folder:
```bash
cd wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/
```

Create `.env` file and set `GRAPHQL_URL` to `https://bucket-list-workshop-graphql.josedusv.now.sh/graphql` (see `.env-sample`):

```
GRAPHQL_URL=https://bucket-list-workshop-graphql.josedusv.now.sh/graphql
```

Install the dependencies by running
```bash
yarn install
```

**Note:** you must use Yarn to install dependencies because this repository makes use of Yarn workspaces; using `npm` will not work correctly.

To run the web version, use the `web` script:
```bash
yarn web
```
and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the result.

To run the mobile version, use the `mobile` script:
```
yarn mobile
```
and press <kbd>d</kbd> to open Expo DevTools. Use these dev tools to run the app on your Android emulator/device or on your iOS simulator.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you successfully ran the project!

## Going through the workshop

If you followed the previous instructions, you are running the app from the `master` branch of this repository. That means you can see what the final app looks like. Take your time to try and play with it to get a feel for what you will need to do later.

This workshop is divided in 5 steps. Each step aims at showing you one aspect of cross-platform development with React Native and React Native Web.

You will need to switch to the step's branch to see the instructions in the README file as well as have the correct starter files for that step.

- [Step 0](https://github.com/kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/tree/step-0): _Intro to React Native_ 

```bash
git checkout step-0
```

- [Step 1](https://github.com/kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/tree/step-1): _Cross-platform navigation_

```bash
git checkout step-1
```
Note: have a look at the [HINTS.md](https://github.com/kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/blob/step-1/HINTS.md) file if you need some pointers.

- [Step 2](https://github.com/kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/tree/step-2): _Intro to GraphQL + Relay_
```bash
git checkout step-2
```
- [Step 3](https://github.com/kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/tree/step-3): _Using Storybook on mobile and web_
```bash
git checkout step-3
```

- [Step 4](https://github.com/kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/tree/step-4): _A little puzzle_
```bash
git checkout step-4
```
Note: have a look at the [HINT.md](https://github.com/kiwicom/wkshp-bucket-list-travel-app/blob/step-4/HINT.md) file if you need some pointers.

**Warning:** There are no "solutions" branches; the steps sort of build into each other, which means you could switch to the next branch to see how you could have solved the previous one. There are no explanations available at the moment; feel free to post an issue and ask if something seems unclear.
